## Selected Publications

- 2024/01: [DebugBench: Evaluating Debugging Capability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04621)

We have evaluated the debugging abilities of common LLMs, and we found that open-source LLM did poor on that task 

- 2023/11: [ProAgent: From Robotic Process Automation to Agentic Process Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10751)

We explored using LLM to automatically generate RPA workflows, and how to use LLM as AI-data and AI-logic node in the workflow, which is called APA(Agentic Process Automation)

- 2023/8: [Large Language Model as Autonomous Decision Maker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12519)

We Provided a novel Elo-based tree search method, connecting prior and posterior knowledge, and reaching the SOTA on the ToolBench Dataset

- 2023/7: [Toolllm: Facilitating large language models to master 16000+ real-world apis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16789)

We aligned 16000+ real-world RapidAPI query, tested ChatGPT and GPT-4 to automaticaly handle real-world without human knowledge. Together, we trained Llama on the annotated data, making Llama the same function calling ability with ChatGPT

- 2023/4: [Tool Learning with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08354)

We make the first step towards general tool learning settings, testing on about 30 tasks.
